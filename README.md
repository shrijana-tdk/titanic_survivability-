Titanic Survivability

In this, survived rate was predicted. I used SVC and logistic regression models. The accuracy obtained through SVM model is 60.89% and through logistic regression is 68.15% which suggests that logistic regression is better option than svc in this dataset when checking the survivability rate through Age and Pclass.
